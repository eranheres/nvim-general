## TODO:
- [ ] check fidget addon (like in nvim-ios)
- [ ] read about the trouble plugin
- [ ] check if to use the autosession plugin that is in vim-ios instead
- [ ] create a plugin to sync all the common plugins between nvims
- [ ] check the Obsidian plugin
- [ ] set the borders of splits (different colors)
- [ ] setup other IDEs with copilot 
- [ ] set the actions.json file in ChatGPT to include the vim expert

## Done:

- [x] autosession or use the built in Session command (autosession and sessionlens)
- [x] setup Spectre search and replace (<leader>sr)  - solution use the ^ $ and !
- [x] Set a special GPT helper for nvim using GPT
- [x] run checkhealth and fix issues
- [x] Set search to find a keymap and its configuration using Telescope
- [x] Do I need the windows operations or only buffers?
- [x] setup chatgpt help
- [x] create git repo for this project
- [x] have the autosave command
- [x] copy the list of keys from other profiles
- [x] create shortcuts for toggleterm
